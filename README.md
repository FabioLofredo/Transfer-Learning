# Transfer-Learning

# Project "Chest X-Ray Images" from kaggle.

In this project, we used the database of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/. Transfer Learning was used along with concepts like Data Augmentation, Dropout, and Early Stopping to prevent Overfitting.

In the first phase, ResNet was used alongside a neural network, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.4% and a test accuracy of 79,3%.

To further reduce Overfitting and improve accuracy, ResNet was combined with the Extra Trees machine learning algorithm, resulting in a validation accuracy of 96.9% and a test accuracy of 89.9%.
